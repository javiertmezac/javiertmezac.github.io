# Practice
## Launch an EC2 instance in Public subnet.
- When creating an EC2 instance under public subnet, it automatically assigns a "public ip address"
- Create pem file
- `chmod 400`
- `ssh ec2-user@<ip-address> -i path/to/file.pem`

## Launch an EC2 instance in Private Subnet.
- To connect from "public" EC2 instance to "private" EC2 instance, normally you need to allow the "traffic" by configuring a Security Group.
  - You can use the "subnet ip range" from where public EC2 instance lives. ie. 10.0.1.0/24
  - To connect from public to private EC2 instance, ssh (port 22) should be added as an inbound rule
- IMPORTANT: so far this private EC2 instance won't have access to internet. (for that NAT is needed)

# VPC and ELB

- dualstack means both ipv4 and ipv6 are supported.
- internet-facing
  - load balanacers required at least 2 public subnets

# Direct Connect

# Random Notes
- By default, how many VPCs am I allowed in each AWS region? answer: 5
- In Amazon VPC, and instance does not retain its private IP.
