# Network Access Control List
- When VPC was created, default NACL was created too.
- All new subnets are associated to DEFAULT" NACL, if you have custom NACL you have to manually changed the association.
- By default new NACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
- NACLs can have multiple Subnets, but a Subnet can be associated to only one NACL
- Inbound rules in NACLs are evaluated in chonologial order ie. 100 then 200, and so on. it is recomended to name your rules "increment 100s"
- NACLs are evaluated before Security Groups
- [ephemeral ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html#nacl-ephemeral-ports)
  > A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.
- to block IP Addresses, use NACL not Security Groups
- NACLs are stateless; you have to explicitly allow/deny inbound and outbound rules
