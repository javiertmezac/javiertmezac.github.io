This was long time ago!
I was in college when I decided to do a program for a small company! I chose to use ASP.NET 3.5 with C# 2008

I still remember how I tried to keep the business logic separated, but at the end, there were no SOLID principle followed :joy:

 The good thing is:
 The programm is still in use!

 The bad thing is:
 It really needs to be updated! :smile:
